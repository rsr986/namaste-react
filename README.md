- bundler (ex: parcel, webpack, vite)
- dev dependencies, normal dependencies

npm install -D parcel // -D means dev dependency

- parcel "^2.8.3" "(tilde/caret)major.minor.patch" // what is caret(^) in this version number, and also find about tilde(~) in version number
- tilde(~) will update the package to all future patch versions automatically when available
- caret(^) will update the package to all future minor verisons automatically when available

- what is package-lock.json, what is diff between package.json and package-lock.json
- what is node-modules folder
- what is transitive dependencies
- if you have package.json, you can recreate node_modules by "npm install", node_modules folder is not required to push to repository

npx parcel index.html

- diff between npm and npx?, npm is package installer, npx is package executor

npm install react
npm install react-dom

import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom";
